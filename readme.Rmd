# nmrrr

This script is designed for batch processing and analysis of **NMR r**esults in **R** (nmrrr).    

Use this script for:  
(a) plotting spectra  
(b) calculating relative abundance of functional groups  
(c) peak assignments  

Before using this script, NMR spectra must  be processed in MestreNova (phase corrected, baseline corrected, deconvoluted, peak picked, normalized).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,
                      collapse = TRUE,
                      comment = "#>" #, fig.path = "images/"
                      )
```

Example spectra:  
spectra processed in MestreNova, with automated Global Spectral Deconvolution.   
Water peak removed during processing. Avoid using DMSO and water regions for further analyses.  


### spectra plot version 1: with banded regions for bins
This is good for visualization, not necessarily ideal for manuscripts.  

![gg_nmr1](images/spectra_1.png)

### spectra plot version 2: with bracketed regions for bins
Preferred for manuscripts.  

![gg_nmr2](images/spectra_2.png)

These bins were obtained from [Mitchell et al. 2018, *Soil Systems*](https://doi.org/10.3390/soils2010008).  
(1) aliphatic polymethylene and methyl groups (0.6-1.3 ppm); (2) N- and O-substituted aliphatic (1.3–2.9 ppm); (3) O-alkyl (2.9–4.1 ppm); (4) α-proton of peptides (4.1–4.8 ppm); (5) anomeric proton of carbohydrates (4.8–5.2 ppm); (6) aromatic and phenolic (6.2–7.8 ppm); and (7) amide (7.8–8.4 ppm). The peak at 2.50 ppm arises from the solvent (DMSO-d6).
